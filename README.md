#  👨🏼‍💻 Robert Maltese

I am a self-taught iOS developer in the process of learning the ropes of SwiftUI. I enjoy finding solutions to problems which others find overly challenging. 

- 🔎 I'm currently working on a [independent](https://heatbuddy.app) project which helps solve a crucial issue for homeowners and renters alike!
- 🔨 I have two applications on the AppStore, [HeatBuddy](https://heatbuddy.app) and [HealthCalc](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthcalc-fit-calculators/id1567425913).
- 🏃‍♂️ I'd love to network with other iOS developers of all different levels.
- 📰 I'm looking to work with a team on a project to help gain that knowledge of developing in a team setting.
- 👮 I'm always open to discussing a career change!
- 🌩️ Fun fact : The first person convicted of speeding was going eight mph.
