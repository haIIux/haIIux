## Hello there! 👋

I am a self-taught iOS developer in the process of learning the ropes of SwiftUI. I enjoy finding solutions to problems which others find overly challenging. 

- 🔎 I'm currently working on a independent project which helps solve a crucial issue for homeowners and renters alike!
- 🏃‍♂️ I'd love to network with other iOS developers of all different levels.
- 📰 I'm looking to work with a team on a project to help gain that knowledge of developing in a team setting.
- 👮 I'm always open to discussing a career change!
- 🌩️ Fun fact : The first person convicted of speeding was going eight mph.

I have recently began my own freelance studio which aims to help clients develop an iOS application that solves their number one issue stopping them from succeeding.
